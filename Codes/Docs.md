Hangu - The Pathfinder is a python program that uses the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal path for moving an atom. 
The program takes the size of a square matrix (tweezers), spacing between two points, origin (lower left corner of the tweezers), and the probability of capturing an atom as input. 
It then generates a list of coordinates of positions of the trapped atoms in the tweezers. After that, it generates a list of coordinates of targeted atoms, based on the size of the square matrix and spacing between two atoms. 
Finally, it finds the optimal path for moving the trapped atoms to the targeted atoms using the Hungarian algorithm.
